# Highlights

- TS -> NodeGraph compilation: event entry points, control flow, function reuse.
- Full type hints with bilingual aliases: events, functions, APIs, entity subtypes.
- JS-native and Unity-style APIs, npm ecosystem support.
- `g.server(...).on(...)` chaining, multi-entry merge by identical ID.
- `gstsServer*` function compilation (reusable logic, controlled returns).
- JS-style timers: name pools, closure capture, and dispatch aggregation.
- Constant precompute, dead node removal, local variable reuse.
- Readable IR JSON for debugging and tooling.
- CLI: incremental builds, injection safety checks, map discovery, auto backups.
- Custom ESLint rules to surface constraints early.
- Built-in prefab/resource IDs and enum IDs.
